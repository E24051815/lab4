This program can show size of a character,interger,float,double,
and size of pointer which point to a character,interger,float,double.

Output show size of a char is 1byte    size of a int is 4bytes
            size of a float is 4bytes  size of a double is 1bytes  
but,size of pointers are all 8byte.

It's because that size of pointer not about what it point to,
but depend on your computer system,for example ,if your system is 64-bits,
size of pointer is 8bytes.
